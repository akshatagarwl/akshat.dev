# Problem we faced and background on GitHub Actions billable minutes

A while ago we faced a challenge with GitHub Actions failing due to our
included minutes being exhausted. GitHub Actions provides approximaely 2,000
minutes per month for private repositories, and the Linux runners consume
minutes in multiples of 1. So even if a job takes only a few seconds, a full
minute is deducted from the total billable minutes.

One of our main bottlenecks was running lint checks in our CI pipeline. With a
Go monorepo, we couldn't simply cd into every Go module and lint them serially,
as it would take an excessive amount of time. Instead, we resolved modules and
created a matrix to spawn a single job for each module. While this approach
reduced the overall waiting time for lint checks, it also meant that even if a
particular module took only 2 seconds to lint, a full minute would be deducted.

Moreover, this process was redundant since most pull requests (PRs) would only
change a few modules, making it unnecessary to run lint checks on every single
module.

# The solution

To address this issue, we modified our resolve modules script to only include
modules that have been changed from the main branch. This way, we only run lint
jobs on the modified modules. As a result, our average billable time for the
lint action dropped significantly, from approximately 2 hours to around 5 minutes.
